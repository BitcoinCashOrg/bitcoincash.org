Bitcoin Cash Payment Protocol Workgroup Agenda
==============================================

The purpose of this document is to describe the aim of the workgroup, and gather reference materials and links
that may be useful.

Aim
---

The aim of the workgroup is to improve the BIP-70 specification, and develop improvements to the specification,
and implementations of the payment protocol.

Milestones
----------
Suggested steps and interim goals
 - Conduct a survey of current BIP-70 implementation status, looking at the state of how it is implemented
   across wallets and merchant services.
   - Bitpay
   - Electron Cash - both wallet and merchant side
   - Bitcoin.com - wallet and Cash Register
   - Elipay
   - Other wallets
 - Improve specification for clarity, and to bring it in line with deployed BIP-70 implementations.
 - Work on extensions to the Payment Protocols, such as direct data exchange when wallet is off-line
   (but in close physical proximity), and merchant only the merchant is online.
