2020-11-15 Upgrade Testnet
==========================

The Nov 15, 2020 Bitcoin Cash will undergo a planned network upgrade.
The purpose of this upgrade testnet will be for testing of the upgrade activation and features.

The upgrade testnet is not yet operational, please check back again later,
or check the [Telegram Group](https://t.me/joinchat/DUeWWkYZbVMjvwMTRFlRhw) for news and updates.

## Activation Testnet

In order for businesses and services to test activation of the new rules, a Scheduled Activation
testnet is available which forks off from the regular testnet on a daily basis. It performs a test
activation every day when a block of median time past (MTP) 12:00 UTC is mined.

To join the next day's activation testnet, go to [activation-explorer.bitcoincash.org](https://activation-explorer.bitcoincash.org), copy the
timestamp of **tomorrow's** activation and set your node's <em>axionactivationtime</em> to that.

Note: Between 9:00 and 11:00 UTC every day, the Activation Testnet Explorer goes down for maintenance
and is temporarily unavailable while the infrastructure is prepared for the next activation at 12:00
UTC.
