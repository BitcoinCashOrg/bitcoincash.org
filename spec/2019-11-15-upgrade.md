title: 2019-NOV-15 Network Upgrade Specification
date: 2019-05-29
activation: 1573819200
version: 0.1 DRAFT SUBJECT TO CHANGE
---

**Important: This document is an in-progress draft, and likely to change prior to the 2019-11-15 upgrade**

## Summary

When the median time past [1] of the most recent 11 blocks (MTP-11) is greater than or equal to UNIX timestamp 1573819200,
Bitcoin Cash will execute an upgrade of the network consensus rules according to this specification.
Starting from the next block these consensus rules changes will take effect:

* Enable Schnorr signatures for OP_CHECKMULTISIG(VERIFY)
* Enforce minimal pushdata 
* Enforce NULLDUMMY (BIP0147)
* Change the rule limiting signature operations in script.

The following are not consensus changes, but are recommended changes for Bitcoin Cash implementations:

* Automatic replay protection for future upgrade

## Schnorr Signatures for OP_CHECKMULTISIG(VERIFY)

In-progress draft specification: 
https://github.com/markblundeberg/bitcoincash.org/blob/pr-multischnorr/spec/2019-11-15-schnorrmultisig.md

## Enforce minimal pushdata

TBD. May follow existing standardness checks, and enforce that all pushed data is a minimal representation at the script layer.

Also possible that this consensus rule may be more modest, to only apply to data pushed in scripSig.

## Enforce NULLDUMMY

Enforce that the dummy element in OP_CHECKMULSIG(VERIFY) is a null
stack element.  This will go into effect at the consensus layer.

## Sigops Limit

TBD. In principle the current heuristic should be replaced with a new rule for the sigops limit should account for
signature operations that are actually executed in script.

## Automatic Replay Protection

When the median time past [2] of the most recent 11 blocks (MTP-11) is less than UNIX timestamp 1589544000 (May 2020 upgrade)
Bitcoin Cash full nodes MUST enforce the following rule:

 * `forkid` [1] to be equal to 0.

When the median time past [1] of the most recent 11 blocks (MTP-11) is greater than or equal to UNIX timestamp 1589544000
(May 2020 upgrade) Bitcoin Cash full nodes implementing the Nov 2019 consensus rules SHOULD enforce the following change:

 * Update `forkid` [1] to be equal to 0xFF0002.  ForkIDs beginning with 0xFF will be reserved for future protocol upgrades.

This particular consensus rule MUST NOT be implemented by Bitcoin Cash wallet software. Wallets that follow the upgrade
should not have to change anything.

## References

[1] The `forkId` is defined as per the [replay protected sighash](replay-protected-sighash.md) specification.
