# Summary

In the [previous network upgrade](https://github.com/bitcoincashorg/bitcoincash.org/blob/master/spec/2018-nov-upgrade.md) a constraint on transaction size had been introduced, namely every transaction with size lower than 100 bytes is considered invalid since Nov 15 th upgrade activation.

The constraint was introduced to protects against a [Merkle tree vulnerability](https://bitslog.wordpress.com/2018/06/09/leaf-node-weakness-in-bitcoin-merkle-tree-design/)
that allows attackers to spoof transactions against SPV wallets.

This is a proposal to relax such constraints so that a transaction should be considered invalid if its size is equal to 64 bytes.

For a more comprehensive description of changes proposed for the next network upgrade please have a look at https://github.com/bitcoincashorg/bitcoincash.org/blob/master/spec/20190515-may-upgrade.md

# Motivation

The vulnerability only affects transactions that are exactly 64 bytes long.

The previous 100 bytes constraints brought some burden to mining pools / miners, in fact changes to the code had to be applied to make sure the coinbase transaction was always greater or equal to 100 bytes.

This change does not require any changes to wallet / SPV implementations.

# Implementations

Implementations for both BitcoinUnlimited and Bitcoin ABC would be provided well before February 15th 2019 so that we will have enough time to evaluate and review them.
